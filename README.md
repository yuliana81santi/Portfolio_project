# My Portfolio Project

This is my first IT project. I created this page as a part of an IT course that I am currently doing. This webpage contains my portfolio where people can know who I am. I have included basic information about myself, my educations, my experiences, as well as how to contact me.

This webpage can be used by any potential employers or company who would like to hire me to get detailed information about myself. 
I like to keep the website simple as it suits my style and make it easier for any readers to navigate around the website.
