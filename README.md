# My Portfolio Project

This is my first IT project. I created this page as a part of an IT course that I am currently doing. This webpage contains my portfolio where people can know who I am. I have included basic information about myself, my educations, my experiences, as well as how to contact me.  

UX
---
This webpage can be used by any potential employers or company who would like to hire me to get detailed information about myself. 
I like to keep the website simple as it suits my style and make it easier for any readers to navigate around the website.  


## Features

**All Pages**
- Full screen overlay menu - My website contain navigation links which will direct users to the relevant pages.
- Navigation links - It is located in the right top corner of the web pages to help users to navigate around my web pages. 
- Footer - It is located at the bottom of each page in the center. 

**contact.html**
- Facebook and LinkedIn hyperlinks are provided for the user to connect with me through social media
- form with send button - It allows users to provide their names and email address and send messages to contact me. No further action is taken when "send" button is clicked due to the limitation of this project.  

**Features left to Implement**

Once I have learnt more about Javascript and Back-end Web Development, I will improve some features of my website
- the "send" button in the contact.html will provide a prompt to inform the users that their message has been succesfully sent. 
- use javascript to prompt hyperlinks in new windows.


## Technology Used
- HTML5
  I used html5 as the basic element to create my website.
