# My Portfolio Project

This is my first IT project. I created this page as a part of an IT course that I am currently doing. This webpage contains my portfolio where people can know who I am. I have included basic information about myself, my educations, my experiences, as well as how to contact me.  


UX
---
This webpage can be used by any potential employers or company who would like to hire me to get detailed information about myself. 
I like to keep the website simple as it suits my style and make it easier for any readers to navigate around the website.  



## Features


**All Pages**
- Full screen overlay menu - My website contain navigation links which will direct users to the relevant pages.
- Navigation links - It is located in the right top corner of the web pages to help users to navigate around my web pages. 
- Hamburger button - When the webpages are shrunk, the navigation links will be displayed in a hamburger button. 
- Footer - It is located at the bottom of each page in the center. 


**contact.html**
- Facebook and LinkedIn hyperlinks are provided for the user to connect with me through social media
- form with send button - It allows users to provide their names and email address and send messages to contact me.   

**Features left to Implement**

Once I have learnt more about web design, Javascript and Back-end Web Development, I would like add some features and improve the design of my website to make it more attractive.




## Technology Used
- HTML5

  I used html5 as the basic element to create my website.
- CSS3

  I used CSS3 to add styling to the content of my webpages.
- Bootstrap v5.1.3

  Bootstrap provides prebuilt components that are easy to use and responsive to different devices. It also adds styles to the website alongside my custom design. 
- Git

  I used Git as version control to add, edit, and commit any changes made in the webpage content before pushing it to Github.
- Github

  I used Github as my remote repository and used it to deploy my website. 
 
- Visual Studio Code


I used visual studio code as the code editor to write and develop the code for my website. 


## Testing


**Responsive Testing**

I used a few web browsers to test my website to make sure that they are presentable.  I also tested my webpage against different type of devices (i.e laptop and mobile phones) to ensure they are responsive and displayed properly on difference screen sizes. 


**HTML and CSS Validation**

I used [W3C HTML Validator tool](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) to validate the HTML code

I used [W3C CSS Validator tool](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) to validate the CSS code




## Deployment

I've used Github as the hosting platform for my portfolio project. To deploy my website to GitHub, I used the following steps:
1. Run the terminal window in my Visual Studio Code.
2. Initialised Git using the `git init` command.
3. Added files using the `git add .` command.
4. Committed the files using the `git commit -m " "` command.
5. Created a new repository called 'portfolio_project' in Github.
6. Copied the below code from GitHub into the terminal window in my Visual Studio Code editor:
    ```git remote add origin https://github.com/yuliana81santi/Portfolio_project.git```
    ```git push origin main```
7. Entered my GitHub username and password to push the files from Git to GitHub.
8. Regularly commits and push my project files using Git to Github.

## Running Code Locally

Users can clone and copy my code for this project with the following steps:
1. Go to [my github repository]
(https://github.com/yuliana81santi/Portfolio_project.git).
2. Click copy or clone the link.




## Interesting bugs or problems

-**Burger Icon** - The burger icon was shown on the overlay menu. To solve this issue, I adjusted the header1 width.

-**Social Media Links** - I used JavaScript code to open the social media links in a new window but it only worked for the last one only. After consulting my mentor, He showed me a simpler way to do it, using HTML code only.

-**Mobile Friendly Website** - I added viewport in my head section to make my website mobile friendly. However, after adding the code and check my website, It was not responsive. My website on mobile devices looked exactly the same as if it was opened in a laptop and was difficult to read. I took me a few days to realized that I had misspelled the word viewport. After correcting my spelling, it become mobile friendly.
